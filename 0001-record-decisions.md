# 1. Record decisions

## Context

I often find myself revisiting the same idea over and over, while not remembering why I bailed the last time, thinking that "surely, this time it must work" or "if I just spend a few more hours...".

This usually happens when there's no obvious superior alternative or an acceptable compromise, I then keep digging myself deeper, but ending up wasting a lot of time and effort and feeling disenchanted.

Reading about a subject over and over has positive aspects, but at a certain point it becomes drastically less fruitful for every pass.

Externalizing this process helps me to not end up overwhelmed and have a more spare time.

Projects based on prototypes or breaking new ground are bound to experience complications/problems to solve with no definitive solution.
I believe being able to encounter this and still make progress is a crucial skill for high performers.

## Considered Options

### Wetware Processing & Storage

As mentioned in the context, keeping everything in my brain is unreliable, while also inducing unwanted sideeffects such as sleep deprivation, social relation neglect, increased imposter syndrome and irrational hyperfocusing on details.

### Bullet Journaling

I use a journal to write down my thoughts and ideas every day, but I never really managed to use it as a reference for complex information, as representing some kinds of data can be really hard with pen and paper.

Appending to existing non-collection lists also has real physical constraints and breaks the format a bit.

Collections (having dedicated notebook pages for a specific topic) hasn't worked out for me in practice.
I forget that I have a relevant collection and keep using the daily log for things that should be in the collection.

BuJo is great as the default place to write down an idea and manage short term WIP, but it's not super duper for managing long term projects.

BuJo is also a single player game, so it naturally doesn't scale to multiple people.

### ADR - Architecture Decision Records

What bullet journaling taught me is to simply log what the context is, what the options are and then either expand the option list or decide what to do.

ADR provides structure and defines how to append new information to old content.

Being fluent in applying ADR is attractive as it is intended to scale beyond single player and be applied in organizations.

## Decision

I will use ADR and as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) to keep a paper trail of my projects.

## Consequences

I will use ADRs when outlining personal projects and document my conclusions.
