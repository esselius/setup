# 2. Development Environment

Date: 2021-05-25

## Status

Accepted

Amended by [3. Development Environment - Secret Management](0003-development-environment-secret-management.md)

## Context

I develop and maintain software systems.
I require access to an editor, language runtimes and other tools.

I'm most comfortable with a unix (or unix-like) OS, like MacOS or GNU/Linux.

I want configuration as code because I believe this enables testing and reliable rollback of changes.

I think configuration changes should to be verifiable without causing risk of disrupted work.

## Considered Options

## Decision

I will use MacOS with a NixOS in a VM, using my editor and tools all through the normal VM-window.

## Consequences

I need to decide how to do secret management and make my nixos configuration hospitable for every day use.
